# CFL_Blogpost
This repo contains the accompanying code to our blogpost about "Causal Feature Learning" by Chalupka et al.

TODO: add the link to the blogpost when online


You can run the code by cloning this repo locally and launching Julia within the folder. Afterwards, you can run the following commands to install the necessary packages:

```julia
(YOUR_JULIA_VERSION) pkg> activate .
